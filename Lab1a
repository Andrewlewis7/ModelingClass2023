// 
// Objective:

// This lab assignment aims to practice working with variables and operators in the C# programming language. By exploring the concepts covered in the web pages, you will gain hands-on experience in declaring variables, assigning values, performing operations, and understanding operator behavior in C#.

 

// Instructions:

// Watch the video as part of this assignment to use the built-in code editor, or open your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) or a text editor to write your C# code.
// 2. Visit the following web pages:

//    - [https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_variables.php](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_variables.php)

//    - [https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_operators.php](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_operators.php)

// 3. Read through the content on both web pages, paying close attention to the explanations, examples, and code snippets provided.

// 4. Write a C# file that incorporates the concepts of variables and operators discussed on the web pages.

// 5. Declare and initialize variables of various data types, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Ensure that your variable names are meaningful and follow proper naming conventions.

// 6. Utilize different operators covered in the second webpage, such as arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators. Include examples that demonstrate the behavior of these operators with your variables.

// 7. Add comments to your code to explain the purpose of each variable and operator and the expected output of each example.

// 8. Test your file by executing it and verifying the output https://www.w3schools.com/cs/trycs.php?filename=demo_variables.

// 9. If you encounter issues or errors while writing the code, use the provided web pages as references to resolve them.

// 10. Once you have completed your file, save the file with an appropriate name and the .cs extension.
